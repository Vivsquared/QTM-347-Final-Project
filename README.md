# Diagnostic Prediction - Breast Cancer 
**Authors: Jennifer Jiang, Vivienne Yu**

## Abstract
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States, but the diagnostic process can take weeks or months. Because of this situation, we would like to use machine learning models to reduce the diagnostic times. By testing different subset selection models, we have found 13 most effective variables,'concave points_worst', 'radius_worst', 'texture_worst', 'area_worst', 'smoothness_se', 'symmetry_worst', 'compactness_se', 'radius_se', 'fractal_dimension_worst', 'compactness_mean', 'concave points_mean', 'concavity_worst', 'concavity_se', to determine the dependent variable, 'diagonsis'. Then, we applied several machine learning models to see which one leads to the most accurate results and found that Logit Model and Random Forest produced the most accurate prediction for this classication diagnostic prediction project.
